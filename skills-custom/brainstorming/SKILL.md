# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.


<PRECONDITION>
`using-superpowers` should already have been invoked in the top-level conversation before this skill.
Dispatched subagents must not invoke it here.
</PRECONDITION>

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Offer visual companion** (if topic will involve visual questions) — this is its own message, not combined with a clarifying question. See the Visual Companion section below.
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria until you can name the real decision to be made. When the user has already named what they want to build or design, include a brief initial recommendation in the first clarifying question unless the request is too broad.
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — explain what each option means, how the outcome changes if chosen, why it is a candidate, and which option you recommend
5. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
6. **Self-review approved design** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, and scope (see below)
7. **Transition to implementation planning** — invoke writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan from the approved design and requirements

    "Visual questions ahead?" -> "Ask clarifying questions" [label="no"];
    "Offer Visual Companion\n(own message, no other content)" -> "Ask clarifying questions";
    "Ask clarifying questions" -> "Propose 2-3 approaches";
    "Propose 2-3 approaches" -> "Present design sections";
    "Present design sections" -> "User approves design?";
    "User approves design?" -> "Present design sections" [label="no, revise"];
    "User approves design?" -> "Design self-review\n(fix inline)" [label="yes"];
    "Design self-review\n(fix inline)" -> "Invoke writing-plans skill";
}
```

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single implementation plan, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own design → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria
- During clarifying questions, include a brief initial recommendation in the first question when the user has already named what they want to build or design, unless the request is too broad for a credible recommendation
- Keep early recommendations short, assumption-based, and easy to revise as the user's goals and constraints become clearer
- If the request is too broad, recommend decomposition or scope narrowing first
- If you offer multiple-choice answers during clarification, briefly explain what each option means so the user can answer accurately
- Repeated back-and-forth questions are still part of clarification if the goal is to understand the user's intent rather than compare concrete solution directions

**Exit criteria for clarification:**

Move from clarifying questions to approaches when all of the following are true:

- The primary user goal is clear enough to restate in one or two sentences
- The main constraints or priorities are known
- The decision space is narrow enough that 2-3 real approaches can be compared
- Further questions would mostly refine solution choice rather than reveal intent

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Treat this as the stage for comparing concrete alternatives and giving a strong recommendation, even if an earlier clarifying question included an initial recommendation
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why
- For each option, explain what the option is, how the result changes if the user chooses it, and why it is worth considering for the stated goals and constraints
- Make recommendations conditionally and explicitly tie them to the user's stated priorities
- If the user's goal is still unclear, ask another clarifying question instead of pretending the approaches are fully formed

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design - the way a good developer improves code they're working in.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**No separate spec document:**

- Do not write a separate spec document by default.
- Treat the approved design in the conversation as the source of truth for planning.
- If the user explicitly asks for a design document, you may write one, but it is optional and is not a gate for planning.

**Design Self-Review:**
After the user approves the design, look at it with fresh eyes before handing off to planning:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other? Does the architecture match the feature descriptions?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan, or does it need decomposition?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? If so, pick one and make it explicit.

Fix any issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan from the approved design and requirements in the conversation
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **Initial recommendation in the first question** - When the user has already named what they want to build or design, include a brief initial recommendation in the first clarifying question unless the request is too broad
- **Strong recommendation after clarification** - Reserve concrete option comparison and strong recommendation for the approaches stage once goals and constraints are sufficiently clear
- **Explain option meaning** - When presenting options, make sure the user can tell what each option means and why it differs from the others
- **Explain outcome differences** - When proposing directions, state how the outcome changes depending on the chosen option
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Visual Companion

A browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Available as a tool — not a mode. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through the browser.

**Offering the companion:** When you anticipate that upcoming questions will involve visual content (mockups, layouts, diagrams), offer it once for consent:
> "Some of what we're working on might be easier to explain if I can show it to you in a web browser. I can put together mockups, diagrams, comparisons, and other visuals as we go. This feature is still new and can be token-intensive. Want to try it? (Requires opening a local URL)"

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Do not combine it with clarifying questions, context summaries, or any other content. The message should contain ONLY the offer above and nothing else. Wait for the user's response before continuing. If they decline, proceed with text-only brainstorming.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use the browser or the terminal. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

A question about a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What does personality mean in this context?" is a conceptual question — use the terminal. "Which wizard layout works better?" is a visual question — use the browser.

If they agree to the companion, read the detailed guide before proceeding:
